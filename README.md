Exploratory Data Analysis : Nutrition Fact for McDonald's Menu

I have explored the McDonald's dataset to find the answers for the following questions:

How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?
How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?
Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?
What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs?
